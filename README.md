# Abstract
---------

Significant wave height (SWH) stems from a combination of locally generated ``wind sea'' and remotely generated ``swell'' waves. In the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, wave heights typically undergo a sinusoidal annual cycle, with larger SWH in winter in response to seasonal changes in high-latitude storm patterns that generate equatorward propagating swell. In the California coastal region, local expansion fan wind events occur in boreal spring and summer, leading to a wind speed (WSP) annual cycle with a distinct maximum in boreal spring and local deviations from the expected hemispheric-scale annual cycle in SWH\@. Other ocean regions with a WSP annual cycle reaching a maximum in late spring, summer, or early fall are designated as seasonal wind anomaly regions (SWARs). In this study, intra-annual variability of surface gravity waves is analyzed globally using two decades of satellite-derived SWH and WSP data. The phasing of the annual cycle is used as a metric to identify SWARs. Global maps of probability of swell based on wave age confirm that the wave field in SWARs is typically dominated by locally forced waves a higher percentage of the time than surrounding regions during the spring and summer months. The magnitude of the deviation in the SWH annual cycle is determined by the exposure to swell and characteristics of the wave field within the region. We find that local winds have a more pronounced impact on Northern Hemisphere SWARs than on Southern Hemisphere SWARs due to the larger amplitude cycle of Northern Hemisphere winds.

# Abstract

Significant wave height (SWH) stems from a combination of locally generated ``wind sea'' and remotely generated ``swell'' waves. In the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, wave heights typically undergo a sinusoidal annual cycle, with larger SWH in winter in response to seasonal changes in high-latitude storm patterns that generate equatorward propagating swell. In the California coastal region, local expansion fan wind events occur in boreal spring and summer, leading to a wind speed (WSP) annual cycle with a distinct maximum in boreal spring and local deviations from the expected hemispheric-scale annual cycle in SWH\@. Other ocean regions with a WSP annual cycle reaching a maximum in late spring, summer, or early fall are designated as seasonal wind anomaly regions (SWARs). In this study, intra-annual variability of surface gravity waves is analyzed globally using two decades of satellite-derived SWH and WSP data. The phasing of the annual cycle is used as a metric to identify SWARs. Global maps of probability of swell based on wave age confirm that the wave field in SWARs is typically dominated by locally forced waves a higher percentage of the time than surrounding regions during the spring and summer months. The magnitude of the deviation in the SWH annual cycle is determined by the exposure to swell and characteristics of the wave field within the region. We find that local winds have a more pronounced impact on Northern Hemisphere SWARs than on Southern Hemisphere SWARs due to the larger amplitude cycle of Northern Hemisphere winds. 

# Plain Language Summary

At the ocean surface, wave height can give insight into ocean-atmosphere interactions.  Storms generate waves, which are known as swell when they propagate away from their point of origin.   Swell waves account for most of the global ocean's surface waves. They vary annually with large waves in the winter and small waves in the summer due to seasonal changes in high-latitude storm systems. In some coastal areas, including the coast of California, local wind effects cause exceptionally high wind speeds in late spring. These strong local winds result in large waves in springtime, separate from the global-scale winter maximum in swell waves. Places with strong local winds during the late spring, summer, and early fall, here referred to as seasonal wind anomaly regions (SWARs), are identified using global satellite observations of wave height and wind speed. Details vary by location. SWAR wave fields depend on the exposure to swell as well as the strength of the local winds. Compared with Southern Hemisphere storms, Northern Hemisphere storms have a stronger winter peak, which means that local winds have a larger influence in Northern Hemisphere SWARs than in Southern Hemisphere SWARs.
